<p>
    My every day IDEs of choice are JetBrains'.
    I would like to share some of the tips and tricks I use to make my life easier.
    In this blog post, I will focus here on Intellij IDEA because that is the IDE I currently use the most, but many
    of those features equally apply to other JetBrains' IDEs.

    Although it is quite resource-intensive, its many features make it worth it.
</p>

{{< h2 "Code Completion" >}}

<p>
    Code completion is an important features of any IDE, and can be used to speed up development.
    Intellij IDEA has a lot of features to make code completion even more powerful.
</p>


{{< h3 "Basic completion" >}}

{{< h2 "Live Templates" >}}

<p>
    Live templates are a great way to speed up development.

    Live templates are available in different scopes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Simple</strong>: </li>
    <li><strong>Parameterized</strong>: </li>
    <li><strong>Surround</strong>: </li>
</ul>

{{< h2 "Getter, Setter, HashCode, Equals and ToString Generation" >}}

<p>
    Writing getters and setters can be a tedious task, and the success of Project Lombok probably comes from its ability
    to generate them automatically.
    Intellij IDEA also has a built-in feature to generate getters and setters for the fields you select.
    It can avoid you having to add the Lombok dependency to your project (with its custom pre-processor), but you will
    need to generate them again if you change, remove the existing fields, or add new ones.
</p>

<p>
    To generate getters and setters, you can use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Insert</kbd> shortcut, or right-click on the
    class and select <code>Generate...</code>.
</p>

<p>
    The final generation feature is the <code>toString()</code> method.
    It is very useful to have a readable representation of your objects, especially when debugging.
    Intellij IDEA can generate a <code>toString()</code> method for you, based on the fields you select.

Again, you can use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> +
<kbd>Insert</kbd> shortcut, or right-click on the class and select <code>Generate...</code>.

{{< h2 "Comparison with Project Lombok" >}}

<em>{{< a/ext "https://projectlombok.org" "Project Lombok" >}}</em> (or simply <em>Lombok</em>) is a very popular library that provides generation abilities
similar to the ones described above (getters, setters, toString, equals, hashCode).
It is very useful to avoid writing boilerplate code, but it

<p>
    Its main advantage is that it generates code at compile time, meaning that the generated code will always be
    up-to-date with the fields of your class.
</p>

<p>
    The inconvenience is that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>it requires a dependency to be added to your project;</li>
    <li>Lombok uses a custom annotation processor, which can be a problem if you use other processors (e.g. MapStruct)
        or when you manually configure the compiler (e.g. with [maven-compiler-plugin]);
    </li>
    <li>it can be difficult to debug the generated code, since you never see it. Note that debugging the
        Lombok-generated code is not a common task;
    </li>
    <li>the generator has limited customization options: while you can configure some aspects of the generated code,
        having direct access to the generated code would allow you to customize it completely.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Which one is best for you depends on your use case, constraints and preferences.
    I generally use Lombok in the development phase of a project, which saves me a lot of time writing that kind of
    boilerplate code.
    Then, when the project becomes more stable, I remove Lombok and replace it with the Intellij IDEA-generated code.
