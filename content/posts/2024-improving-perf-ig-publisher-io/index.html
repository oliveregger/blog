implementation guides."

<p>
    The {{< a/ext "https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher" "IG Publisher" >}} is the reference tool to build FHIR
    implementation guides. It is a Java application built upon the FHIR Core library, that reads the implementation
    guide sources and generates a FHIR package and a web documentation. It is a quite complex application, and new
    versions are released quite regularly.
</p>

<p>
    I recently had to build a large implementation guide, and it took the IG Publisher around 3 hours to complete. The
    memory usage was quite high (around 20 {{< abbr GiB >}} at peak) and the result was a 2.57 {{< abbr GiB >}}
    directory. While waiting for the completion, I was wondering if there was a way to reduce the completion time.
</p>

<p>
    The first step to improve the performance of the IG Publisher is to understand what it does, and which operations
    are the most time-consuming. To do that, I cloned the IG Publisher code from the
    {{< a/ext "https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher" "GitHub repository" >}}, quickly wrote a
    <code>main(String[])</code> method, and ran it with the
    {{< a/ext "https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/profiler-intro.html" "profiler included in Intellij IDEA" >}} on
    the {{< a/ext "https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html" "CH Core" >}} implementation guide. This IG has a good
    size, not too big, not too small, and it is a good candidate for a performance analysis.

<p>
    My attention was immediately drawn to the <code>fileToString(String)</code> method, which take a significant
    amount of time (around 7% of the total time). Opening the class confirmed it was used to read the
    content of files, an operation that should usually be fast. The code looked like:
</p>

{{< highlight java >}}
public class TextFile {
    public static String fileToString(String src) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException  {
        CSFile f = new CSFile(src);
        if (!f.exists()) {
            throw new IOException("File "+src+" not found");
        }
        FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(f);
        try {
            return streamToString(fs);
        } finally {
            fs.close();
        }
    }

    public static String streamToString(InputStream input) throws IOException  {
        InputStreamReader sr = new InputStreamReader(input, "UTF-8");
        StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();
        int i = -1;
        while((i = sr.read()) > -1) {
            String s = Character.toString(i);
            b.append(s);
        }
        sr.close();

        return b.toString().replace("\uFEFF", "");
    }

    // [...]
}

<p>
    That class also contained multiple methods that looked implemented in a suboptimal way. Let's check their
    execution time in the generated profile:
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="methods_before.png" alt="TextFile methods execution time before optimization"/>
    <figcaption><code>TextFile</code> methods execution time, before I/O optimization</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    A few methods are taking a significant amount of time: 19 seconds for the <code>streamToString(InputStream)</code>
    method, around 5 seconds for the <code>fileToString()</code> methods and 3.5 seconds for the
    <code>bytesToString(byte[])</code> method. I was not expecting such long execution times, especially for the last
    one. Let's work on optimizing that.
</p>

{{< h2 "Optimize the code and verify the results" >}}

<p>
    To optimize the <code>fileToString(String)</code> method, the simplest solution is to use the
    <code>java.nio.file.Files.readString(Path)</code>. But while testing the modified code, errors started to appear
    when reading Excel spreadsheets. After some investigation, I found that the <code>readString(Path)</code> methods
    failed while reading invalid UTF-8 byte sequences. An almost equivalent method that does not fail in that case is
    <code>new String(Files.readAllBytes(Path), Charset)</code>. Both methods use the <code>readAllBytes(Path)</code>
    method, but use different UTF-8 decoders.
</p>

<p>
    For many methods, I avoided using <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>,
    <code>InputStreamReader</code> and <code>OutputStreamWriter</code> as much as possible. The Java NIO API is quite
    helpful to write fewer lines of code, while directly getting a quite optimized implementation.
</p>

<p>
    After those changes, it is time to run the profiler again, and compare the results:
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="flamegraph_after.png" alt="Flame graph of the IG Publisher after optimization"/>
    <figcaption>Flame graph of the IG Publisher building an implementation guide, after I/O optimization</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    The <code>fileToString(String)</code> method is barely visible on the flame graph, and it represents now only
    0.36% of the total time. It seems that the optimization was successful. To be sure, let's compare the execution
    time of the methods in the <code>TextFile</code> class after the optimization:
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="methods_after.png" alt="TextFile methods execution time after optimization"/>
    <figcaption><code>TextFile</code> methods execution time, after I/O optimization</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    All methods are now under the 0.4 seconds threshold, which is a significant improvement. The
    <code>streamToString(InputStream)</code> method is 51 times faster, the <code>fileToString(String)</code> method
    18 times faster. Not bad for a small patch that also simplifies the code!
</p>

<p>
    Switching from execution time to memory allocation view, the improvement is also significant: the
    <code>streamToString(InputStream)</code> method allocates 300 {{< abbr MiB >}} instead of 23 {{< abbr GiB >}}, the
    <code>fileToString(String)</code> method 545 {{< abbr MiB >}} instead of 6 {{< abbr GiB >}}. Avoiding the
    creation of temporary objects prevents a lot of memory allocation.
</p>

<p>
    I also created unit tests for that class, to ensure that the behavior is the same as before. The patch is now
    ready to be submitted to the core library.
</p>

{{< h2 "Further optimizations" >}}

<p>
    I was surprised to find code that manage UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM) in various methods that read or write files.
    It is becoming really rare to encounter a UTF-8 BOM in the wild, because they are ultimately useless: the byte
    order of UTF-8 is fixed, contrary to UTF-16 and UTF-32. While their use in UTF-8 is allowed, the specifications
    explicitly discourage it. Removing that support would not really optimize the code, but it would surely make it
    simpler.
